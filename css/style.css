These are the font import that I've been using on this project.
    font-family: "Great Vibes", cursive;
    font-family: "Bebas Neue", system-ui;
    font-family: "Poppins", sans-serif;
    font-family: "Courier Prime", monospace;

  I have been using these fonts on the VILAS website because I was trying to find some fonts to showcase the beauty
  of visagism and also to demonstrate how even a rustic detail can make all the difference.
  Also, I would like to talk about the website color here. First of all, I’ve been using black and white because,
  in my opinion, it is an amazing combination that matches with anything. Additionally, this color scheme helps people with visibility problems,
  such as color blindness, which is my case (Yes, I am colorblind). It helps us and includes these people as well.

  You can navigate through the whole CSS document using shortcuts.
  Ctrl+F and find the names of the pages or specific blocks to make it easier.
  The sections that I've been writing about here are:
  Note: Copy only the name, no numbers.
  However ensure use the quot marks when necessery to find the topics successfully.
